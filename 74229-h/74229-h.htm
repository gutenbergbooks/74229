      <div class='line'>Dear Billy:—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Not having traveled overly much it
is not to be supposed that you are
higher than a three-spot when you
switch on to this subject, but “tipping
as she is tipped” is one of the up-to-date
accomplishments, Billy.</p>

<p class='c005'>I propose in this letter to throw my
little piece of radium on to it and show
it up to your tender eyes, for it certainly
dazzles me. I heard a street
preaching guy telling about the advancement
of all things and he named
over everything he could think of but
left out the drum major of the bunch,
the cap sheaf, as it were, the one great
and only that heads the procession.
There is an art in tipping but the art
is soon learned; one of the lost arts,
however, is to get along without tipping.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>The more I see of tipping the
more I am convinced it is the correct
thing, and the guy who started the
anti-tipping club needs to roost high
or he will get his tail feathers clipped.
Just the same, I believe in the anti-tipping
club. I wish that seventy-five
per cent or more of the travelers
would join it, then I would keep on
tipping and be a true enough top-notcher.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is only one tipping rule for
the man who travels, and that is to
tip and keep tipping, particularly if
you desire to get what is coming to
you. Some methodical dubs have
adopted the rule of giving to the waiters
ten per cent of the amount paid
for a meal. My plan is to give something
if nothing but a cussing, but to
give according to what I receive—and
a good cussing is all that is coming
to some of them, according to my
rule.</p>

<p class='c005'>I found a waiter in Shanley’s once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>who had been spoiled by the ten per
cent habit. I dropped in there with a
piece of calico and the bill came to
six dollars and fifty cents. I gave
his nibs seven dollars and when he
brought back the half, I said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Keep it, old man.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He lifted it on the plate and cocking
one eye, said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“The bill was six fifty,” meaning
that I ought to come down with fifteen
cents more.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s right,” said I, “sixty fifty
is enough for any dub to pay for a
dinner,” and I pocketed the half and
walked out.</p>

<p class='c005'>I think he fainted,—at all events,
I heard something fall as I walked
away. The girl asked what the trouble
was and I said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing, only the waiter was too
honest to take a tip,” and then she
fainted.</p>

<p class='c005'>The size of the tip that a fellow is
supposed to be separated from depends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>a good deal on the place; as a
rule, the higher priced place you
strike either in a hotel or restaurant
(perhaps I should say a cafe), the
smaller the portions and the larger the
tips. You see in a real tony place
where there is lots of gilt, pictures and
Oriental rugs, the less they can afford
to give you to eat and the more you
have to pay for it; and the size of the
tips you give should increase in proportion
to the shrinkage of the portions
you receive.</p>

<p class='c005'>I started to go into a place in New
York where the flunkeys were diked
out with knee pants, silver shoe
buckles and powdered wigs, and the
silverware was sixteen-to-one on the
tables, but when I saw the smiles on
the faces of those flunkeys I backed
up and got out. You see I was hungry
and only had three thousand dollars
in my pocket, and the Lord only
knows what those powdered flunkeys
would have held me up for; besides,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the dinner check would have been
something.</p>

<p class='c005'>The first time I went to Atlantic
City I wanted to get wise on the tipping
game, so I asked a modest looking
waiter what I was expected to
give up for tips in a place like that.
I did not have to wait long for an answer.
It was on the heels of what I
said so quickly I thought I must have
said it myself, “Howmuchyougot?”
It was a stiff game, but I stood it a
week and then went straight through
to Chicago. That was the time I
came home on crutches, Billy, don’t
you remember?</p>

<p class='c005'>There is one thing I could never
bring out straight and that is, how
the average traveler will give a greasy
nigger from a quarter to a half for
giving him slight attention at the table,
when they will let a nice, neat
white girl wait on them in first-class
shape and then walk off without so
much as a “thank you.” That ain’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>me, Billy, the girls get my money. For
that matter I suppose you will say
they always did. All right, old man,
I have no kick coming.</p>

<p class='c005'>Did I tell you I came near getting
married while I was down in Washington,
D. C.? You see it was this
way, Billy: Burt Olmstead was there
with his wife, and we were all stopping
at the Baldy, and Mrs. Olmstead
told me she had been watching the
girl who takes care of the hats and
coats at the entrance of the dining-room,
and as near as she could figure
it out the girl was pulling in in tips
ten or fifteen dollars a day. That
looked awful good to me, and the next
time I went in to dinner I stopped to
have a talk with her. I had waited
until the rush was over so as to have
plenty of time, and say, Billy, she
wasn’t such a bad looker I found when
I got my orbs on her at close range.
The conversation was something like
this, commencing with myself:</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“Are you married?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Would you like to be?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I don’t know. That would
depend some on the con man.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you mean by the ‘con
man?’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ain’t you wise to that? Why, no
guy gets a girl unless he cons her into
it. I didn’t think you were scant in
the top-knot, you don’t look the part.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never mind the ‘scant’ part. Just
throw your lamps on me and tell me
how you think I would stack up for
the place.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are all right for looks, but
how about the mazuma?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’ll have the mazuma all right
if you will train in my company.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s all right, Duke, but what
about my steady?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why don’t the duffer marry you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He ain’t ready yet, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, that’s where your steady and
me differ. I am ready right now.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>You can put your shoes under my
bed and commence P. D. Q. on one
condition.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is the condition?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That you will hold on to your job
right here until I can get hold of as
good a graft.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Say, Billy, she grew two inches taller
in half a minute, and then she
struck an attitude and throwing her
right hand out with the palm down,
she said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Walk on, man; I have had offers
from four Italian counts and two English
lords within a week, but as they
all suggested the same conditions, I am
still single. But say, you are a good
looker and if you should happen to
want a job as chauffeur I might use
you with my new touring car.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Wouldn’t that give a fellow a smell
of gasoline, though?</p>

<p class='c005'>I made a foolish bet once while in
Denver, with Dug Green. I bet him
twenty plunks that I could live at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>the Blue Palace a week without tipping
anyone about the hotel. The
only place that troubled me was the
dining-room. I was sure I could get
away with the bell boys and porters,
although I knew I would get myself
very much disliked. You know how
bad I hate to get beat, Billy, so you
must know how hard I tried to save
that twenty, but it was no use—I soon
found I was fighting against big odds
and that the other side had some great
generals. We made the bet on Monday
morning before breakfast, and I
was to commence at once. As I went
into the cafe that morning I picked
out a waiter whom I had tipped quite
liberally the week before, and said to
him:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sam, bring me a nice little breakfast.
You know what I like.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Sam brought me a nice sirloin steak,
shirred eggs, rolls and a cup of coffee,
and on the steak was a couple of slices
of crisp bacon. When through with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>my breakfast I walked out without
giving Sam a tip. He showed his
surprise and disappointment very
plainly. According to my arrangement
with Dug I was not to make any
promises of future payment, and was
to eat in the same dining-room during
the week.</p>

<p class='c005'>At lunch time Sam waited on me
again and looked more puzzled than
ever when I walked out without tipping
him. At dinner I sat at another
table and had another waiter, who
of course knew that I had not tipped
Sam, as every customer in a hotel is
spotted and his measure taken by each
flunkey for the benefit of the others.
This waiter seemed to think that for
some reason I had taken exceptions
to Sam, therefore, he laid himself out
to do his best to win my favor, thinking
to draw an extra tip from me.
It was of no use, however, as when
through I walked out, leaving nothing
to smooth the rough places off his
hard and lumpy thoughts.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>My plan then was to change tables
each meal, as I thought in that way I
could get through the week and save
my bet, but you know the old saying,
“White man proposes and a nigger
trips him up”—at least Dug told me it
was an old saying. Imagine my surprise
the next morning as I sat down
to a table far removed from Sam’s side
of the dining-room to find that he was
to wait on me.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bring me a nice little breakfast,
Sam,” said I, and it was brought—that
is, it was little but not nice. The
steak was tough, the bacon was raw
and the potatoes were cold. I stood
it until Thursday morning, and then
dodged into the dining-room when I
saw Sam had all he could attend to.
As I came in the door the head waiter
sent some one to take Sam’s place, and
Sam came to me with a smile on his
face that boded no good for yours
truly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sam,” said I, “you d— rascal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>you bring me a nice breakfast; you
know what I like and you see that it
is all right. If I have any more of
your nonsense I will talk to the head
waiter about you, and if that doesn’t
do any good I will tie you up in a knot.
I mean what I say, do you hear me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I sho does,” said Sam, and he left
me without another word.</p>

<p class='c005'>I made up my mind that I was on
the right track to win the twenty. Dug
came in when I did, but as we had
agreed not to sit together, he had
taken a seat at another table. I was
interested in flirting with a girl at another
table, and when I looked around
Dug was through with his breakfast
and was evidently waiting to see how
I was coming out. After a time a
strange coon came in with my breakfast,
and a worse outfit I never have
struck up against. The steak was stone
cold and so was the coffee.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Boy,” said I, “where in h— has
this meat been since it came off the
fire?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>“Sam done took it outen de ice
chest, sar.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Out of the ice chest?” questioned I.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, sar, he done tole me you war
a hot-headed sort o’ pussen, sar, and
dat you had to hab yo’ breakfast cooled
off, sar.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I looked at the nigger. He was
about six feet tall and a good, husky
fellow withal, and I then noticed that
the coat he had on was several sizes
too small for him. I caught on to the
scheme. Sam had changed places
with a pot wrestler and sent him in
to save himself trouble. I looked over
towards Dug, and he had on a broad
grin. Then I caught a glimpse of the
head waiter. He had a queer look on
his face that I did not understand.
The whole thing was too much for me.
I gathered up the dishes that held the
steak, coffee, eggs, etc., and the next
thing that happened they landed square
on that nigger’s head and shoulders.
The weight of the truck took the big
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>brute to the floor, and there was a
mixture of eggs, steak and nigger that
must have taken some time to scrape
apart. The nigger picked himself up
and fairly flew to the kitchen, and
there was a commotion in the dining-room
better imagined than described.
I was on my feet mad enough to fight
a Spanish bull. While I stood there
glowering at Dug and the rest of the
push, I spied Sam keeping just out of
my reach. I knew I was beaten, and,
digging a dollar out of my pocket, I
motioned him to me and said, as I
handed him the dollar:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here, you black rascal, bring me
my breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In three minutes more Sam was
back with a breakfast to my liking. I
afterwards found that my breakfast
had been cooked for me each morning
but I had to give in to get it.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is a moral in this: Tip and
keep tipping; that is the only way you
can get what is coming to you. I not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>only lost the bet, but I queered myself
with the girl I had been flirting with
for a week.</p>

      <div class='line'>Dear Billy:—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Writing on train is not the best of
a task, but when I feel like writing
I must write or you would get no letters.
I have just been in to dinner in
the dining-car, and there I met a tan colored
coon who used to wait on us
up to the Poker Club on Clark Street.
That coon ought to be rich with the
tips he has pinched out of us; most
likely he would be if he had not played
so much policy.</p>

<p class='c005'>You ought to have seen him swell
up when he saw me; he acted as
though he was carrying the secret of
my birth, or something else equally
as interesting. He started to shake
hands with me, but when he saw that
three-karat uneasy payment diamond
I am wearing in my shirt front, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>backed up and got away. He came
back as soon as he could get his breath
and I had the best there was in the
car and a very large portion of it. Of
course, he expected a half for what he
stole from the company, and of course
he got it, but it made me feel as though
I had laid myself liable to arrest as an
accessory before the fact in a larceny
case.</p>

<p class='c005'>Running across this nigger and noticing
how easy he pried a half out of
me, made me hark back to other things
that have happened and then I got
doubtful as to my former decision as
to tipping being the right thing to do.
After all it is not so much a question
of right and wrong as it is a case of
can a fellow afford not to do it?</p>

<p class='c005'>I remember going into a Broadway
hotel in New York once and deciding
beforehand that I would do no tipping.
The first time I went into the dining-room
the head coon bowed me in very
graciously, as he had never seen me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>before, and I most likely looked easy;
he gave me in charge of a dull-looking
waiter and let it go at that. The
waiter was bum, to put it mildly, and
as I made up my mind that I did not
owe him anything, he did not get anything.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next time I went into that dining-room
I was given a different table
and a different waiter. This waiter
was a little better than the other one
and seemed to try hard to do everything
to please me, but I had steeled
my heart against all waiters and I was
not in a mind to show the white feather
or the soft heart, whichever it might
be called.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next time I came into the dining-room
I received very slight notice
from the “King of the Cannibal
Islands,” as I had designated the big
moke at the door, and I was turned
over to the tender mercy of a six-foot
coon who had a hand like a ham and
teeth that reminded me of a mile of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>painted fence palings. This black
slugger did not waste any time on me.
He demanded my order as though he
meant my watch and diamond pin, and
when he came back with the stuff, he
threw it at me as though he was pitching
quoits at an iron pin. He only
gave me a half portion of butter, and
then kept out of my way so I could
not get any more.</p>

<p class='c005'>I called to another waiter, but the
only satisfaction I got was:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not waiting on you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When I asked him to call my waiter,
I was passed by as though he had not
heard me. I called the assistant head
waiter, only to be told that the waiters
were very busy, and were doing the
best they could.</p>

<p class='c005'>When I realized I was up against it
good and plenty I rested on my oars,
awhile, wondering how I would play
even. While I was thinking it over
and wondering if I would be obliged
to acknowledge myself beaten, my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>waiter, thinking I was through, came
to me and asked if I was done. At
the same time another waiter came on
the scene holding a huge tray high
over his head. The tray was filled
to the guards with everything from
soup to pie. An idea struck me, but
I had to be quick.</p>

<p class='c005'>I dropped my fork, my waiter
stooped to pick it up, and, as he was
stooping, I kicked my chair from under
me and, throwing myself on all fours
in front of the fast approaching waiter
with the tray, causing him to trip and
bring the tray and its contents fair on
top of my waiter’s back and head.</p>

<p class='c005'>I escaped without a spatter, the incoming
waiter got but little, but the
poor devil of a nig that was supposed
to wait on me got a good bit more than
I expected, for he was not only
drenched with the soup, gravy, chicken
potpie, custard pie, and a few other
edibles, but a broken piece of crockery
or glass took him in the back of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>head and cut a good-sized gash. Either
this or his striking the floor with his
head put him out of business, for he
never moved a muscle. The head
waiter and the assistant head waiter
came rushing up, and there was a general
stampede of guests to see what
was the matter. I was the first to demand
to know how it all happened.</p>

<p class='c005'>The proprietor came in and gave
orders for the removal of the debris,
and, incidentally, of the waiter also.
He was picked up and carried out, and
so were the dishes.</p>

<p class='c005'>After the nigger had been carried
out, there was a good deal of talk
about how it happened. They found
the nig who had the tray and demanded
of him what part he had in it.
He was just about to open his mouth
when I stepped in front of him,
clenched my fist and looked him square
in the eye.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fo’ de Lawd, I don’ know how it
all did come about. I jes’ tripped on
sumthin’ and dar I was.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>With this explanation Mr. Nig
slid out of the way. The next time I
came in the dining-room I was fitted
out with an umbrella handle. It was
one of the largest ones I ever saw and
shaped not unlike a revolver handle.
This I had in my hip pocket. I threw
my coat tails to one side and exposed
for a moment the top of the handle to
the gaze of the head waiter. After I
was sure he had seen it I walked up to
him and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look here, Sam, you saw my gun,
but you only saw one of the pair.
They are forty-fours and will carry a
bullet through a six-inch plank. Now,
I don’t propose to be held up by you
damned rascals any more. What I
want of you is to put me to the same
table each time, give me as good a
waiter as you have in the house, and
see that I am waited on in first-class
shape. If you do this, all right; if not,
there will be a pile of dead niggers here
that will bring on international complications.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“I don’ know what yo’ mean, sar.”</p>

<p class='c005'>My hand went to my hip pocket, but
before I had time to draw, the moke
threw up his hands and cried out:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fo’ de Lawd, mister man, you can
hab any waiter yo’ want.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The head waiter seated me himself,
and I was never waited on better in
my life, and it was kept up as long as
I stayed in the house. I expected to
be interviewed about those concealed
weapons, but was not, and the umbrella
handle did service equally as
well as a cannon.</p>

<p class='c005'>The negro is strong on long words,
and about three days after my calling
down the head waiter, he stopped me
as I was leaving the dining-room and
said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mister Henderson, what’s dis yer
international complexions you told me
about dat day?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is it possible you don’t know, Sam?
Don’t you attend church every Sunday?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“I suah does, sar, but we hain’t got
none of dose things about our church.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, yes you have, only you don’t
see all there is going on about the
church. International complications,
Sam, act the same on the heart as vermiform
appendix does on the liver,
and it is a serious thing when they both
begin working at once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, sar,” said Sam, as he bowed
me out, and there was a puzzled look
on his face that proved to me that I
had raised about twenty feet in his estimation.
I was only there two days
more, but I think he stood more in
awe of me on account of the big words
I tossed him as I passed him each day
than of the two big guns he thought I
had.</p>

<p class='c005'>I was stopping in Detroit at one time
and had been introduced by some
would-be society sports to the smart set,
and Detroit has a smart set, even if
the people generally are bigotted. I
suppose these society boys thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>they would have some fun with me
when they got me up against some of
those society bathing costumes, but I
did not balk at them. I had seen
them before on people who did not lay
claim to so much respectability.</p>

<p class='c005'>Perhaps I should say why I claim
that the people of Detroit are bigotted.
I want to tell you, Billy, you can gamble
that the people of any town are
bigotted when they will not accept
Standard time, but have Sun time for
their business and claim that the railroad
people are a half an hour out of
the way. The so-called Christian
people should rise above anything of
this kind, for these two-time towns
are the cause of more profanity than
any other one thing that I know of.
All the prayers of all the good people
in Christendom will not keep the
traveling men out of h— if they don’t
get this fool idea out of their heads of
having a time of their own in these
jay towns, and it can only be a jay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>town that will keep that much behind
the trains.</p>

<p class='c005'>Standard time was inaugurated for
the benefit of all the people in the
United States, and these guys who are
not willing to go with the push have
no particular excuse for living.</p>

<p class='c005'>I started to tell you about my adventure
with the smart set in Detroit,
or rather my adventure at one of their
functions. That word functions, Billy,
is answerable for a lot of bum doings
that I know about, and that only
covers a small territory. I had on my
turkey tail suit, just like a waiter, and
felt as though the waist bands of my
trousers were coming up through that
big hole in the front of my vest. I
had on a little dinkey tie, made out of
some white stuff that I did not dare
to put my hands on for fear I would
make a mark on it, and I had one of
those choker standing collars like a
priest, that keeps a fellow guessing
whether he is coming back or going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>ahead. On the whole I was not feeling
any too good with that suit and
perhaps was not altogether answerable
for what I said and did.</p>

<p class='c005'>When a lady looked at me more
than a second I thought something was
the matter with my clothes, and I
could feel my face getting as red as a
pickled beet.</p>

<p class='c005'>I was standing around looking as
though I would sell myself for a song
or less, when one of those waistless
dresses started toward me. It had a
woman in it and I got scared. I
thought she was about to tell me my
collar was unbuttoned or that my
shirt front had wilted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Henderson,” said she, “will
you please send for an ice for me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sure,” said I, quite relieved that it
was no worse. I turned about and
seeing a fellow that I thought waited
on me that morning at the hotel, I
said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here, Jim, run along and get this
lady an ice.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Jim did not move, and thinking he
was waiting for a tip in advance, I
handed him a quarter, saying:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Get a move on you now, don’t
waste any more time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am a guest,” said he, but he
spoke so low the lady did not hear,
but she heard me tell him to get the
ice, and I could see but one way out.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You get that ice,” said I, “or I will
break your d——d head. I did not
know you were a guest and you have
no business to look so much like a
waiter,” and I not only made him get
the ice, but I made him take the quarter.</p>

<p class='c005'>I think they would do better up
there if they used Standard time.</p>

      <div class='line'>Merry Christmas, Billy:—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>This is the time and this is the
town. It is Christmas and there is
no town that needs it more than this
one does. In Chicago when a fellow
puts on a polished shirt front he usually
comes in with a polka dot at least,
but here it changes from a laundry
polish to a shoe polish.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here we are, right in the midst of
the festal season. Dug and I have
been trying a new kind of liquor every
day for a week to get the exact right
thing for the holidays. Queer about
Christmas, Billy, there seems to be
something in the air that makes a
duffer want to give something to
every guy who is worse off than he is.</p>

<p class='c005'>I saw a hard looking old dub on
the street on Christmas morning; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>did not seem to know which way to
turn; his clothes were whole, but had
been worn shiney. He had no overcoat
and his old plug hat looked as
though it had done duty for many a
year. I touched him on the shoulder
and said to him:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come with me, old man, and take
a drink.” The old man looked surprised.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t drink, sir,” said he, “and
it would be better for you if you did
not, either.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right, old man,” said I, “I admire
your principles, but I deplore
the loss of so much fun on your account,
and by the way,” said I, noticing
how drawn and pinched the old
man’s face looked, “if you wouldn’t
waste so much money on grub and put
a little of it into good whiskey for
yourself, it would help out your looks
a heap.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I imagined the old man looked hurt
at something I had said and not wishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>to hurt anyone’s feelings on Christmas
morning, I handed him a dollar
and left him. He seemed to take the
dollar reluctantly and I felt then that
I must have touched the old man’s
pride.</p>

<p class='c005'>As we walked down the street I noticed
we were followed by a couple of
nicely dressed gentlemen, and I also
noticed that they were wonderfully
pleased about something; in fact, they
seemed to be immoderately pleased
for they were laughing good and
plenty. As they came close to us I
turned and said to them:</p>

<p class='c005'>“If that is a jag you have you ought
to have divided it with some one else;
it will hurt you to carry that load all
day.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” said one of them as he
leaned against a tree and talked between
laughs, “we are not jagged, but
we are willing and it is up to you to
do the proper.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Up to me,” said I, “what’s chewing
you?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“Oh! not a thing, only I was wondering
how you would feel when you
found out that the fellow you gave the
dollar to was old Josiah Grubb, who is
known to be worth two million and is
too mean to feed his face regularly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Billy, I have had a good many raw
turns, but this capped them all. I
thought at first I would go back and
make him cough that dollar up again,
but I only went back to prove that
our two new found friends were right.
Then I bought wine. This Christmas
giving is a great stunt, Billy, and
there is certainly one dollar that I have
put into safe keeping.</p>

<p class='c005'>Speaking of Christmas giving reminds
me that the average Christmas
present is a gift of something that we
would like to own to someone who has
a very bad opinion of our individual
taste.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dug has a cousin who is attending
a theological school in Boston and a
couple of days before Christmas, Dug
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>had wired me to send this cousin a
suitable present. This was a little
out of my line, but I did the best I
could and then promptly forgot about
it. On Christmas day Dug received a
number of presents, and among them
a bundle from Clarence Hulburt, the
theological student. Dug showed it
to me; it consisted of two books, one
was Bunyan’s “Pilgrim’s Progress,”
and the title of the other was “How
to Be Good Though Rich.” Dug was
laughing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What an ass,” said I, “sending
such things as that to anyone.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This waked Dug up to the fact of
my buying something for this same
fellow and he asked me what I sent
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sent him?” said I. “I sent him
the neatest little poker outfit you ever
laid your eyes on, four decks of cards
and over three hundred chips. The
cleanest looking white ones and red
ones that would make you bluff on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>pair of fours, and blues that were a
dream. I never had so many chips on
my side of the table at one time, and
for a fact, Dug, I hated to see them
go.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dug turned as pale as a ghost and
groaned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is the matter?” said I, jumping
towards him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Matter,” said he, “you d——d
idiot, do you really mean to tell me
you sent an outfit like that to a man
who is studying for the ministry?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why not,” said I; and up to now
I can’t see what there was to groan
over. There was sure more fun in
that poker outfit than in the books he
sent to Dug, if I am any judge.</p>

<p class='c005'>Christmas is all right, though, even
if the presents don’t fit the right spot.
I never knew of but one family that
could hit it right every time. That
family consisted of a man and his
wife. The man usually bought his
wife a box of cigars or a pipe, and she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>would buy him a pair of earrings, a
breastpin or a box of candy. If he
did not like the earrings she would
wear them, and the cigars never came
amiss. Taking it all in all, it is a day
that makes a fellow feel generous,
whether the money he is spending belongs
to him or to some one else.</p>

<p class='c005'>Christmas Eve I went into the hotel
barber shop to get shaved. As I sat
down in a chair I noticed that I had
drawn a long, cadaverous-looking cuss
for a barber who seemed to take full
possession of anything that came
within his reach. He had caught on
to my name, somehow, and as I sat
down he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your hair needs trimming, Mr.
Henderson. It is a little ragged
around the edges.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I knew well enough that my hair
did not need cutting, and was about to
say so when he butted in with:</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s Christmas to-morrow, you
know, Mr. Henderson,” and while he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>was saying it he was pulling out the
headrest. It was Christmas Eve, and I
did not want to make him feel bad, so
I let him go ahead. One thing I liked
about him, he did not seem to be one
of the talking kind; that is to say, he
did not say much, but what he did
say you felt that he meant. After he
was through cutting my hair, he laid
my head back, and, with those long
swipes of his, laid the lather on all
parts of me that showed above my
collar. Then he commenced on me
with his razor. He was long at this.
He would lay his razor on above my
cheek-bone, and with one swipe would
rake down over my cheek and land
under the tip of my chin. I fairly
held my breath. After he had given
me a couple of swipes of that kind he
stopped to wipe his razor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look here,” said I; “what did you
work at before you struck the barber
trade?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stock Yards,” said he, taking a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>swipe down the other side of my face
with that infernal razor; “used to be a
ripper,” he added. And before my
mind’s eye came a long row of hogs
strung up by the hind legs and my
friend of the razor going down the
line giving each one a slash down the
middle. Again I held my breath, and,
after a few more of those swiping cuts,
I was washed off and jerked into an
upright position.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Singe?” I heard him say, and, before
I could utter a protest a blaze
of fire was dancing about my head.
This was another case of hold your
breath. Then I was thrown on my
back again, and lengthy was massaging
my face. He was handling it as
though it was a piece of putty, and I
wondered if I would know myself if
I ever got a chance to look in the glass
again. Then I was bounced into an
upright position again, and I heard
him say something about the danger
of taking cold. The next I knew those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>long fingers were going through what
was left of my hair, executing what
he called an alcohol shampoo. There
was nothing further he could do for
me, but, as he presented me with my
check, he slipped a bottle of hair tonic
into my pocket.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Greatest tonic on earth,” said he.
“There are indications that your hair
will begin to fall out in a few years,
and you should be prepared.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The check was two dollars and forty
cents. I handed him three one dollar
bills.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thanks!” said he, looking at the
bills. “Sixty cents is the smallest tip
I have had today, but it is all right,
old man. Come in again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I clinched the bottle of hair tonic
in one hand and a strong desire came
to me to kill that barber on the spot.
I took a step towards him. He had
put the money away, had gotten hold
of his razor with his right hand, and
was stropping it on the palm of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>left. A vision of those slashed hogs
came before me, and I walked out, but
if I ever meet that man separated from
his razor, there is going to be trouble.</p>

<p class='c005'>I am keeping a little book now and
putting in it the things to be avoided.
One of the first things down is to
avoid a hotel barber shop on Christmas
Eve. You can never forget that
it is Christmas time. They commence
telling you about it a week before
Christmas, and don’t let up until a
week after New Year’s.</p>

<p class='c005'>When you first come into a hotel
the boy shows you to your room, and
after setting down your grip in the
only place in the room where you
would rather not have it, he fixes the
windows. They most likely don’t
need fixing, but he fixes them anyway.
If they are shut, he opens them, and
if they are open he shuts them. Then,
if you don’t notice him, he stands on
one foot awhile, then changes off and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>stands on the other. Then he coughs,
and, if that doesn’t fetch you, he says:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Anything more I can do for you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>You say “No,” and he puts you
down for a cheap guy and then goes
down and tells the news to the rest of
the bell hops.</p>

<p class='c005'>The one who showed me up at this
place wasn’t to be put off so easy. After
he had worked all the old grafts he
said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s going to be fine weather for
Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right,” said I. “If you will
pull off a good sunshiny day, you can
come to my room and get a half a dollar,”
and then the little beggar asked
me if I was going to be here Christmas.
I got rid of this boy for the
time being on a promise, but I knew
that half would have to be paid if
Christmas brought in a cyclone.</p>

<p class='c005'>The elevator boy sprung a new one
on me. He handed out a catch-penny
Christmas box and said:</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“Ain’t that a peach?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sure,” said I, wondering what he
would say next.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then put a stone in it,” said he.
That cost me a quarter.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the dining-room each waiter
wished me a “Merry Christmas,” and
then you would see his hand slide out
toward you as though he could not
help it. Every chambermaid on my
floor swore that she had waited on
me at some other hotel, but the boy
at the coat room took the palm. He
wiped off my boots with a cloth,
helped me on with my coat and
brushed it, then as I was walking
away, said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you, sah; thank you, very
kindly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What in H—— are you thanking
me for; I didn’t give you anything.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, sah; no, sah!” said he, hesitatingly;
“I only thanked yo’ cause
yo’ let me bresh yo’ off, sah.”</p>

<p class='c005'>What a fellow needs is one of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>change-holders that the street car conductors
use, with a place for each kind
of a coin. But he would need more
than that. He would need a national
bank to keep the thing supplied.</p>

      <div class='line'>Dear Billy:—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The New Year’s days have come,
the saddest of the year—when every
dub a fellow knows swears off on
booze and beer. Oh, say! But doesn’t
it make you tired—this swearing off
business?</p>

<p class='c005'>I went down the line on New Year’s
morning, from the Malton to the Singum
House, and every man I asked to
take a smile cocked his eye, shook his
head and croaked “water wagon.” I
went back to the Malton, pulled Dug
out of bed, and could hardly wait for
him to dress before I hurried him
into the bar for a morning’s morning.
D— a man, I say, who doesn’t know
when he has enough. That was the
toast we drank to, and before we had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>worn that toast out we certainly had
enough and we knew it.</p>

<p class='c005'>We did some great calling on New
Year’s day, but a fellow can’t call at
every booze joint in the Quaker City
without having a load he can feel. In
our wanderings for new booze joints
to conquer, we accidentally got into a
barber shop. I think it was the bottles
of colored fluid that attracted us.
We were trying to find an excuse for
coming in when I saw a sign which
read: “No one allowed to tip the barbers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good,” said I to myself; “here is
one place where we play even.” I
called Dug’s attention to it, and we
planted ourselves in chairs. That was
the slickest shave I ever got, and the
barber I had—why, he ought to have
been a trained nurse: he was so solicitous
of my health and comfort.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This not allowing you chaps to
take any tips is a great scheme,” said
I. “How do you like it?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“Like it,” said the barber; “it’s
great. And we make more this way
than we did before.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“More pay, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, we get the same pay.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then how can you make more?”
The barber laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then you ain’t on?” said he. “It’s
the slickest ever. You notice that little
fancy cup on the shelf?”</p>

<p class='c005'>I told him I had noticed it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” commenced he, “that cup
does the business. We are not allowed
to receive any tips, and we tell everybody
so, and we also tell them about
the fancy cup, and tell them we cannot
help it if they want to send a present
to our baby, and it is a nervy guy
who will toss in less than a quarter
on a plea like that. It looks small, you
know. Besides, my baby has not been
feeling well for the past few days.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So you are married and got children?”
said I.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, no; not exactly. I am not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>married, and of course haven’t any
children, but I have the sweetest baby
you ever saw. She is about twenty-seven
summers old, and if any one
should ask you, she is about the warmest
baby in the bunch, and she does
need money. Say, my friend, a chap
came in here yesterday that put a dollar
into that fancy little dish and he
said, as he did it:</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s for the baby.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I got out of the chair. As I did so
he handed me the fancy cup. This
made me mad, and I said to him:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look here, you tonsorial lobster,
you and your baby will be obliged to
worry along without anything from me
for a while longer,” and I looked him
fair in the eye that he might understand
I meant business.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s all right, my friend. You
do exactly as you please, of course.
Should be pleased to have you call
again, and will treat you the best I
know.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>He certainly was the limit and was
trying hard to make me feel like a
two-cent piece. As I turned my eyes
from him they encountered a very
fetching pair of eyes that belonged to
the manicure lady. She not only had
a fine pair of eyes, but she knew how
to use them. I had always thought I
would like to have one of those chiropodist
ladies hold my hand for me, but
I always hated to have it happen before
a lot of barbers; but this one was different.
She could have held my hands
sitting on the sidewalk on Chestnut
Street, with all the shoppers loose on
the street. She made me put one of
my hands in water and soak it up for
a while, and then she commenced to
get in her work. Say, but she had
the softest hands and the most delicate
touch. Oh, my! It just took my
breath away for a minute. After a
while I began to get a little used to it
and found myself able to talk.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are an awfully sweet girl to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>be wasting your time sitting around a
barber shop,” said I; “holding people’s
hands that you have never been introduced
to.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I don’t know!” said the Queen.
“This is no ordinary shop, and my customers
are all very nice.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They can’t be nice enough to you,”
said I, “and it’s a wonder to me you
stay here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you think I ought to do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You ought to get a position where
you would only have one pair of hands
to take care of,” said I; and then for
fear she would not understand me I
said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why don’t you get married?” She
laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know any one who would
have me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did you ever advertise?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” said she. “I never thought
of that. I am doing pretty well here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How much do you get for holding
hands like this?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“Fifty cents is the regular price, but
sometimes I put in a little more work
and then my customers give me more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then” said I; “you just throw in
a squeeze or two and I will make this
job two dollars.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She smiled, which showed her dimples
in good shape, and when she
caught hold of me again I could
feel the effect clear up my back. This
was a new deal for me, but it was
worth the money.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look here, little queen,” said I.
“Why can’t you meet me after you get
out tonight and have a nice little supper
somewhere?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I would like to awful well, but I
am afraid I couldn’t do it. You see, I
have a steady, and I couldn’t afford
to break with him just for one evening
with a stranger.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just my luck,” said I, “I never
saw anything yet that I really wanted
that some guy didn’t have a prior
claim to it.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Just at this time Dug pulled away
from the barber who had him under
control and coming over to where I
was, said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Cut that out, Jack; let’s get out of
this.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The queen cut her work short, but
she froze on to the two dollars just
the same, and worse than that she
handed it to the barber whom I had
refused to tip, saying as she handed it
to him:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here’s two bucks for you, Charlie,”
and then turning to me she added,
“that’s my steady.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The d— lout of a barber got my
money after all. I met the queen on
the street once afterwards. Her eyes
were not working, some one had
bruised them for her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s the matter, little one,” said
I, “who has been trying to put your
lamps out?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That steady of mine,” said she, “he
accused me of holding out on him.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“Why don’t you quit him, little
one?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I couldn’t do that. You see
he is always good to me when he
doesn’t booze or he gets it into his fool
head that I am flirting with some
one.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And still we wonder at crime.</p>

<p class='c005'>The little queen has passed out of
my life, and me—have I sworn off on
queens? Well, not exactly, but if I
know it I have sworn off on barber’s
queens.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dug and I were out on the Germantown
road the other evening. We
were out to see some friends and had
taken a few bowls with Hank and a
few bowls with Jim, and when we
got ready to start home we were feeling
rich, good natured and prosperous,
and Germantown road, Billy,
doesn’t run the same as the other
streets in Philadelphia, but looks as
though it had been taken from some
other city and dropped into Philadelphia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>crossways. This plays hob with
the street corners and a fellow never
knows where the street cars are going
to stop.</p>

<p class='c005'>We stationed ourselves at a corner,
where we figured they ought to stop,
and waited. When the car came it
went by us like the wind and the motorman
was motioning us to get to the
next corner. By the time we got to
the next corner, the car was half way
down town. Dug was mad, but I reminded
him that we had all night to
get to the hotel in, and that we were
safe for the next car. It was late and
the cars did not run often, but one
came at last. The first thing I noticed
when the car hove in sight was
the motorman gesticulating with all
his might for us to get back to the
corner where we were before. This
made Dug madder than ever and he
would not stir and, of course, the car
went by us again. I laughed, which
did not improve Dug’s temper.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“Think you are smart, don’t you?”
said he. “Now, I am going to make
you pay for this. I will bet you a
sawbuck that the next car stops right
between these points,” indicating the
two corners where we had missed before.</p>

<p class='c005'>I took the bet, taking a chance that
his scheme, whatever it was, would
fail. We both took our places at the
point where Dug said the car would
stop and awaited results. In a few
minutes another headlight showed us
that another car was coming. There
was a cab standing by the curb with a
tag on it marked “Public Cab,” and
when the car was about a block and a
half away, Dug grabbed the whip out
of the socket and caught the horse
by the bridle, and with a little cussing
and whipping, brought the cab directly
across the car track. Unbeknown
to us the driver was sleeping inside
the cab, the movement of the cab
awakened him and about the time the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>wheels struck the car track, the driver
fell out of the door of the cab and
landed on all fours in the street. He
regained his feet and as soon as he
saw Dug at the horse’s head a sulphuric
string of oaths rolled out of
his mouth that it is not often the privilege
of a white man to hear.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You blankety blank fool,” said the
driver, “what are you trying to steal
my horse for?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hold on there, young fellow,” said
Dug, “your horse was running away
and I caught him at the risk of my
life. You ought to thank me, not
curse me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are a liar,” said the cabbie,
“that horse can’t run.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This was too much for Dug and he
promptly knocked the cabbie down.
By this time the car had stopped with
the fender touching the wheels of the
cab. The cabbie had regained his
feet and was hollowing “Bloody murder”
at the top of his voice. Dug let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>go of the bridle and hit the horse a
couple of cuts across the rump. This
set him off on a dog trot down the
road and the cabbie took after him.
Dug and I boarded the car, the conductor
gave the signal to go ahead
and this closed the incident so far as
we were concerned. I guess the cabbie
caught his horse, anyway he
wouldn’t be much loss.</p>

<p class='c005'>It cost me ten dollars, but it put Dug
in good humor and he tells now that
if I want something else to swear off
on I can swear off on betting against
a sure thing.</p>

      <div class='line'>Dear Billy:—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Grafting is tipping on a large scale.
The average man kicks because the
porters, bell boys and waiters hold
him up for his small change, but the
chances are if you should find out all
about the kicker you would find he
was a grafter and one of the worst
kind.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the St. Louis exposition I wandered
into a dancing hall where the
Turkish dancers were going through
their agonies, and in looking about
the audience, I saw a bumpkin taking
in the show. Beside him was his
Sunday girl, who was trying to be
shocked by the performance. After
one or two looks she dropped her eyes
and would not be comforted. The
guy, who was grinning all over his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>face, had to take her out, but she was
only doing what the grafter often
does, playing to the grand stand. If
that girl was my wife I would put a
detective on her trail right from the
start. She reminded me of a woman
I saw in Los Angeles once.</p>

<p class='c005'>This woman was married and very
modest, but she got stuck on a friend
of mine who was a good deal of a
rounder, and she used to come down
town to meet him two or three times
a week. One day she was coming
down in the car and a duffer winked
at her. She was wild with indignation,
shed tears in the car and demanded
that the car be stopped and
the conductor call a policeman. The
masher left the car, the modest lady
kept her appointment with her sweetheart
and telephoned to her husband
from their trysting place that she was
home darning his socks.</p>

<p class='c005'>The telephone is a great thing,
Billy, and by the way it is the bellwether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>as a grafter. Just show this
to the president of the old company in
Chicago, he knows it. It doesn’t do
to judge from appearances, Billy.
Things are not always as they seem.
Speaking of grafting, it doesn’t always
mean money, but it costs money to go
the pace. I was in a town not a hundred
miles from this one a short time
ago when I ran across Johnny Morgan.
You remember Johnny, he was
always one of the good boys. He was
so d——d good it used to make me
mad and I licked him often just because
he was so good that it worried
me. When Johnny got big enough
he went to work instead of living on
the old man, like you and I did, and
I laid it up against him as much as I
did his being good. It seems Johnny
has gotten to be a crack salesman and
is traveling for a school book house.
Easiest thing in the world to sell, I
should think, if a fellow has the best,
but Johnny says not.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Perhaps I am not learning a lot
about tips, or graft, as it is called when
it gets into society. You see in order
to get his books introduced, Johnny is
obliged to present his case to the superintendent
of schools. If he succeeds
in getting him coming his way,
the next thing to do is to tackle the
school board. Johnny got this far in
telling his story to me and it struck
me he was making a strong drink out
of a weak one.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look here, Johnny,” said I, “what
better do you want than that you have
an intelligent, educated lot of men to
deal with who are after the best thing
that can be had for the interests of
the school?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“One minute,” said Johnny, and he
swelled up with his superior knowledge
of the business, “it is not the
educated, intelligent side of the board I
have to deal with, but it is the same
side that the graft aldermen in the
Chicago City Council shows when you
want to get a bill through.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>“Do you mean,” said I, “that these
school boards have to be seen?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do they? Well, I should say they
do, and if they are very intelligent or
very well educated they have to be
seen two or three times.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Wouldn’t that knock an educated
pup off the balance pole, Billy?</p>

<p class='c005'>“How are you getting along in this
town?” said I.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s just it, Jack, I am not getting
along at all. I have them all
but one on my side, but he has sort
of taken a dislike to me and I can’t
budge him an inch. I thought perhaps
you might help me out as you are
something of a schemer, besides you
owe me something for the lickings you
used to give me when we were kids.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right, Johnny, I will help you,
but not on account of the lickings.
They helped to make a man of you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Just then a lady came up the street
who attracted my attention. She was
just my style, tall, slim, dark and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>handsome, and had eyes that talked
in spite of herself. She gave me a
look that went under my vest and
hurt. Johnny had to shake me before
I woke up.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Isn’t she the whole works, Johnny?”
said I.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not exactly, Jack. Her brother is
the part of the works I can’t make go.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Johnny,” said I, grabbing him by
the hand, “now I am in dead earnest.
We will land that order if it takes
the last drink in the bar.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How do you propose to do it,
Jack?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know yet,” said I, “but you
hold the bunch together that you have
and I will agree to land the other duffer—what
is his name, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Doctor Davidson,” said Johnny,
brightening up at my earnestness, “but
I don’t think you know what you are
up against.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never mind what I am up against,
I have given you my promise and Jack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Henderson never goes back on his
word.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I had no idea as to how it could
be done, but I had decided that the
first thing for me to do was to get
acquainted with Miss Davidson. Did
it ever strike you, Billy, how hard a
chap will work to get acquainted with
a woman who strikes his fancy? I
don’t know of anything he will work
harder at unless it is to get rid of one
that he has taken a dislike to. I never
had much experience in that line, but
I was willing to try—no, not willing,
for when I thought of those eyes I
felt that I must try. I went to work
in earnest and found out that she
was the doctor’s pet sister, that she
lived with him and that her front
name was Laura. Billy, I never knew
that was such a pretty name before.
I actually reformed some, I quit
drinking before breakfast.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next thing I did was to watch
my chance and meet her good and fair.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>I bowed and smiled, but she gave me
the busy signal and passed on, then
I waked up to the fact that men did
not get acquainted with this kind of a
girl in that way. Then it came to me
that I had heard that society people
always had to be introduced and I realized
I was up against it right. I could
not help but think of what Dug and
Konk would say if they knew I had
gone nutty on account of a pair of
brown eyes and a smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>My next stroke was a bold one, but
it worked. I dropped in at a church
social after I had seen Miss Laura
enter the church. It is a fact, Billy,
though—if I knew how, I would blush
to tell it—I really went into a church
after those brown eyes. After I got
in there I felt as much out of place as
I ever did in school; the only familiar
face I saw was Laura’s, and I did not
dare to look at her. The minister
came along and I overheard a little
conversation that put me on to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>right track. A lady commenced it by
saying:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I enjoyed your lecture last night
very much.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am glad you liked it,” said the
preacher, “I remember seeing you—your
husband was with you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, no, Mr. Parker, my brother
was with me; don’t you remember I
introduced him to you after the lecture?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, yes, certainly,” said Mr. Parker,
“but there were so many introductions,”
and I knew by the way he
said it he was lying and did not remember
her nor her brother. This
gave me my cue; I got out of that
part of the church and waited until the
Rev. Mr. Parker came my way again,
then I pounced upon him. I shook
hands with him as though he was an
uncle whom I expected would die soon
and leave me a fortune.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Parker,” said I, “you remember
me, Mr. Henderson, I was introduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>to you last night just after your
lecture. I was deeply impressed by
the way you handled your subject.” I
had heard someone else say that to
him, so I knew it must be the proper
caper. He shook hands with me
warmly,—he had to, I was doing the
shaking and others were talking to
him, but I still hung on. Pulling him
towards me I said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Parker, I want you to introduce
me to Miss Davidson.” With
this I walked him across the room to
where I felt she was watching us, and
the deed was done.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Davidson, allow me to present
Mr. Henderson,” and the preacher was
released and gone. I put out my
hand, but there was nothing doing—not
with her hands, but her eyes
sparkled with fun.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Henderson, allow me to congratulate
you on your wonderful
nerve,” said she, and don’t you know,
Billy, that was a body blow for me. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>was down and nearly out and I know
I must have looked foolish. I was not
counted out, though, for I recovered
before anyone could have counted more
than nine.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Davidson,” said I, “I tried to
be square and get acquainted without
an introduction, but you wouldn’t have
it that way, so I did the best I could.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” said she, “and you trapped a
preacher into being your tool to carry
out your plans.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Say, Billy, but those brown eyes
were the only lights in the room, but
she had the hooks into me good and
proper and I was squirming and gasping
for breath. I felt that I could not
hurt my case any and I spoke out
just as I felt and just as I caught
another glimpse of those eyes, I said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Laura, I would have gone to
the hot place and asked the devil to
help me if I could have gotten there
quicker than the way I went to work.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe you would, Mr. Henderson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>and I am glad to know that you
are honest even if your language is
forceful.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Call me Jack,” said I, “and you can
walk on my face.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Say, Billy, wasn’t I gone to the
bumpers, though?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sit down here, Mr. Jack,” said she,
“I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>We sat down, some one came around
with refreshments, cake and ice
cream.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No pot wash for me,” said I,
“haven’t you any—” I was going to
say bug juice, but just then Miss Laura
stuck a pin into my leg and said to the
attendant:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Henderson says he does not
feel like eating ice cream, but will take
something later.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The attendant passed on; ain’t she a
trump, though.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look here, Mr. Jack,” said she,
“did you ever see Mr. Parker before
tonight, or did any one introduce
you?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“You have sized the case all right,
Miss Laura, but what of it? I had to
do it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A song by Miss Davidson,” said
some one, and Miss Laura turned to
me and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Either get your hat and go or else
don’t speak to any one while I am
gone.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Call me Jack,” said I.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Jack.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll be here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She was on to my curves all right.
She knew if I tried to talk to any of
that bunch I would spill. A fellow
with a shock of tan colored hair
worked the piano for her and she sang
something that made me hold my
breath. They gave her the hand and
then she sang “Home, Sweet Home”
in a way that would bring tears from
a deaf mute. When she came back
to me the tears were running down
my cheeks, but I didn’t know it until
she laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“You are a good-hearted boy,” said
she, “but don’t you think you had better
go now? I must not spend all my
time with you, you know, and I want
to talk to some of the other people.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” said I, “this may be my last
chance of heaven and I am going to
see you home.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She looked startled for a moment
and then said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right, you wait here a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She came back in a few minutes
with her things on. I went home with
her and don’t remember to have hit
the ground but three times walking
the four blocks. I don’t know what
she said to me, but she called me Jack
and in some way made it plain to me
that I was outclassed. I stayed up
with the bartender until he closed up
that night, and we got awful chummy
with a dub from New York, who had
invented a new drink. He called it a
“sleeper,” and I guess it was, for I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>did not wake up until twelve o’clock
the next day. When I came down the
first man I met was Johnny Morgan.
He shook my hand as though he had
not seen me for a year, and said, with
tears in his voice:</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are a brick, Jack, you’re a
brick; how did you do it? At a meeting
of the board this morning the doctor
not only voted for my books, but
he talked for them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Johnny insisted on my taking twenty-five
dollars. I hadn’t said anything
about the books, neither had I
thought of them, but it was a case of
graft. Anyway, I took the twenty-five.</p>

      <div class='line'>Dear Billy:—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Since I wrote you last I have learned
a new lesson in tipping. I used to
think that tipping was confined to porters,
waiters and congressmen, but I
have struck a new lead and I begin to
think now that the man doesn’t live
who is not either giving or taking tips,
and the majority of them do both.</p>

<p class='c005'>While stopping here at the Carrie
Hotel I made friends with a traveling
salesman for a lumber concern. My first
meeting with him came near being my
last; the little slim Jim stepped on my
foot and I pasted him one in the jaw,
then for a few seconds there was
nothing doing and then there was.
That little duffer jumped to his feet,
pulled a thirty-two from his pocket and
fired at me. The bullet went wide of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>the mark and before he could think
to fire again, I had taken his gun
away and was holding him and his
gun apart, one in each hand. That
one shot cleared the barroom of all but
we two and the bartender, and he
was lying full length on the floor behind
the bar. The salesman and myself
had both been drinking more than
was good for us, but the shot had sobered
me and I guess it had done as
much for him. I gave him back his
gun.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are a damned poor shot,” said
I, “put up the popgun and let’s take a
drink.”</p>

<p class='c005'>We stood up to the bar and I called
for the bartender, who managed to
get up after a time and set out the red
liquor. When the police arrived we
were touching glasses and in answer
to an inquiry as to where the man was
who did the shooting, I answered:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Couldn’t tell you, old man, we just
came in; will you have a drink?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>The bartender, after he had waked
up to the situation, explained that the
man the police wanted had left by the
rear door and that was the last we
saw of the cops. The bartender then
turned to us and ejaculated:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, you two fellows do extract
the sweet all right. Here you are
chumming together and you don’t
even know each other’s names. Just
you have one on the house while I
introduce you,” which we did and as
we clinked the glasses, the bartender
said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bless you, my children! Harry
Monroe never fired a truer shot than
when he drew bead on Jack Henderson,
for he brought down a friend—get
together there,” and we drank and
shook hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>That was my introduction to Harry
Monroe, and a whiter rounder never
lived. The only trouble with him was
he was obliged to divide his time between
living and earning money to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>live on. Harry got to telling me
about his selling lumber on the road
and how he did it, but it looked a little
punk to me and I told him so. After
I said that there was nothing for me to
do but to make a trip with him and
see how it was done.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was going to make a trip over a
route that he had never traveled before,
and he told me it would give me
an insight into life that I couldn’t get
in any other way. I went and the first
town we struck was a little place up
in northern Kansas, and the first office
we got into was plastered all over with
temperance signs. I took a look at
Harry to see how he took it, but it
never feazed him. He introduced
himself to Mr. Brown, the proprietor,
and then introduced me as his cousin
and said I was traveling for my
health. Then he dropped into a chair
by the side of Brown and reeled off a
string of temperance talk that would
have put the average temperance lecturer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>in the ditch. I never knew what
a fearful thing drink was before.
Harry fairly cried when he told the
dealer how his father and three sisters
went to the bad on account of
drink. Then Harry told him a story
about a man who sold his wife’s washboard
for drink, and, said Harry:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just think, she was the only support
of her husband and six little children;”
then they both cried. We
spent two hours in that office and when
it was almost train time Harry mentioned
his business and took an order
for eight cars of lumber. We made a
quick get-away to catch the train, and
I want to say right here that I was
feeling sort of punk about that story
of Harry’s three sisters. After we
got seated in the car and I found I
could not keep the destruction of Harry’s
family out of my mind, I said to
him:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Harry, is your father dead?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dead, well I should say not! He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>is preaching down in Swampscott,
Massachusetts, and holding his own
with the best of them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And those sisters of yours?” I
added.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, yes, those sisters, I see now.
Well, you see Jack, I never had any
sisters, that’s why I can put them to
the bad so easy. It’s like this, Jack,
every one you meet has to have what
they call down south, ‘Lagniappe;’ in
the north we call it perquisites or
graft. In reality it is a tip given by
one person to another. Now, a salesman
is called on to give out more kinds
of tips and give them out in more different
ways than any other man that
travels. Sometimes we give cigars,
sometimes it’s a drink or a dinner, and
sometimes soft-soap, and other times
its tears, but to be a success on the
road you must give something.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t you ever make a mistake in
giving?” said I.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never did but once.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“Tell me about it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not much to tell, Jack. I gave a
man the measles once and lost his
trade.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He was so nervous about that I felt
for a moment that he had walked into
some fellow’s office and handed out a
package marked “measles,” expecting
to make a hit by doing it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next dealer we struck was a
little, under-sized, florid man, who had
a twinkle in his eye that put you in
good humor at once. This time Harry
introduced me as a druggist out of a
job, and Mr. Wise, the dealer, asked
me if I was a good judge of spiritus
frumenti.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Try him,” said Harry, and Mr.
Wise started for his sash house, motioning
for us to follow. We went
to the farther end of the sash house
and there down inside a pile of sash
Mr. Wise fished out a bottle of whiskey.
I tasted of it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s rotten,” said I, and it was.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Harry laughed and pulling a pint
flask from his pocket, said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I told Jack to say that so I could
offer you a pint of the best that’s
made.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was good, and although Mr. Wise
did not know the difference, he pretended
he did and we didn’t do a thing
to that pint bottle between us in about
ten minutes. The talk of the morning
had made me so dry I could hardly
stand it. Harry got an order for three
cars at that place and then nothing of
real worth turned up for a couple of
days.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was always “nuts” to me to see
Harry deal out the tips, as he called
them, and when we struck a new lead
and were working up a new game, he
would say:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wonder what this geezer will
take, cigars, whiskey, or soft-soap?”</p>

<p class='c005'>One morning about eight o’clock we
came in sight of a lumber yard with
a small office; standing above on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>top of the office was a signboard on
which was painted Capt. J. J. Jones.
I called Harry’s attention to it and
said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“How is that for conceit?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Harry commenced counting on his
fingers:</p>

<p class='c005'>“One, two, three, four, five. That’s
the checker, Capt. Jones, J. J., you are
my meat. He needs the army tip and
I’m the boy who can tip him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>We walked into the office, there
were three men there. Harry never
hesitated a moment but walked up to
one of them, held out his hand, and
said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Captain Jones, I am pleased to
make your acquaintance. There is not
a man who ever fought in the Civil
War that I would not go miles to see.
I have always felt sorry that I did not
live in those stirring times. What
regiment were you in, Colonel?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The—the——Pennsylvania,” said
Mr. Jones, “and there was no finer
regiment in the service.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>The other two men had gone out of
the office.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Colonel,” said Harry, “it must
have been grand to have led such a
regiment as that on the field of battle;
it must have been awe-inspiring to
have sat there on the different horses
that were shot from under you, giving
your orders to the staff officers for this
battalion to charge or that battalion
to take a certain point of vantage. I
can see you now, as you sat upon your
milk-white steed, raise up in your stirrups
and a determined look in your
fearless face, wave your sword and
say, ‘Follow me, men, victory is ours!’
Oh, but it must have been grand. I
tell you, General, I cannot help but
envy you just a little and I will confess
why. During the Spanish War I enlisted
seven times, and each time I was
left behind because my height was too
great for my width. It is awful, General,
to be so afflicted. Now had I
your commanding figure (Mr. Jones
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>was round-shouldered and bow-legged),
I might have died for my
country, and had I a noble brow like
yours (Mr. Jones’ forehead sloped back
like that of an ape), I might at least
have married the daughter of a Moro
chief and been court-martialed after I
got home for leaving her with my
mother-in-law.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Harry was really out of breath and
Capt. Jones broke in and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“You don’t belong in this town, do
you? Are you a traveling man?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” said Harry, with a sigh, “I
am a lumber salesman, but General,
tell me of some of the rivers you swam
and of some of the hair-breadth escapes
you have been through. I could
stay here all day and feast on your
words. You knew Grant and Sherman
and Lee well, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, yes,” said Capt. Jones, “I
have seen them all, but say, what are
two-by-fours worth, delivered here?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Harry woke up with a start.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“By Jove, I must have forgotten myself.”
He took a price list out of his
pocket and throwing it on the desk in
front of the captain, said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“There are my prices, General, if
you want anything pick it out, but let
me sit down here near you and gaze
on a man who at one time was a friend
and confidant of General Grant.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Talk about spreading it on thick,
slush, and all that—well, when we left
the mighty man of war, Harry had orders
for seven cars of lumber.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gee! that’s a good order,” said
Harry, “I wonder if the bow-legged
old chimpanzee is good for that much
all at once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>One night we got into a dealer’s office
about six o’clock; the dealer was
just shutting up to go home. Harry
always introduced me differently to
every one we met and it happened that
at this particular office he introduced
me as a theological student. I was
not at all surprised, as he had introduced
me as almost everything.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>The dealer invited us to go with
him for supper. I wanted to cut it
out, but Harry leaned towards the
house, as I suppose he thought he saw
an order ahead. When we sat down
to supper, there were besides Harry
and myself, the dealer, his wife and
six boys ranging from twelve to twenty
years of age. They had a whole
roast pig for supper, but it was the
smallest pig I ever saw, either dead
or alive. I was hungry and as I
looked around that table and saw the
anxious eyes that were sizing up that
pig, I could not help but think that if
I could get one crack at it myself, that
the rest of them would go to bed hungry.</p>

<p class='c005'>We were all seated, but there was
nothing doing. I looked to see what
the trouble was; the old man was nodding
at me. I glanced at Harry, he
was grinning. I looked myself over
to see what was the matter with me
and then the old man spoke:</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“Please ask a blessing, Mr. Henderson.”
Then it occurred to me that
Harry had introduced me as a theological
student and the perspiration started
out all over me. I knew every eye
was on me and I looked at the pig
for inspiration. The thought came to
me that I must carry out the part if it
took a wing. My eye rested on the
pig as it stood on the platter on all
fours, and its small size struck me
more forcibly. I thought and before
I could suppress the words, I had said
my thoughts aloud:</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s too d——d small.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The boys had been worked up to a
high pitch by the size of the pig and
the failure to get started right, and
they gave a holler that shook the
dishes on the table, the old man looked
ugly, the old woman fainted and during
the excitement Harry and I made
a break for the door. We left that
night; we had queered ourselves with
the only dealer there. Harry was inclined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>to laugh the affair off, but it
seemed to me as though I had made an
awful break somehow. Say, but it
was an awful little pig, though.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Dear Billy:—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Say, Billy, do you cotton to kids?
I don’t suppose you know whether
you do or not, but if anyone should
ask you about me, tell them I don’t.
And I’ve been thinking about it quite
a bit lately.</p>

<p class='c005'>Do you remember Ed Cook? He
came out to Kansas three years ago
and got married. He and his wife
are here now and her sister lives with
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>I met Ed Sunday afternoon. He
was wearing a Y. M. C. A. button,
and looked the part so well that I
didn’t intend to speak to him, but he
signaled me and piloted me up to the
shelf in the apartment building where
he sleeps.</p>

<p class='c005'>We hadn’t been talking very long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>when the door opened and the sister
came in. She was dressed to go out,
and looked as if she was expecting
someone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lou,” said Ed, “let me introduce
Mr. Henderson. My sister, Miss
Hargreaves, Mr. Henderson.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The girl bowed but looked kind of
puzzled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thought you said his name was
Clark,” she said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Clark’s sick—couldn’t come
today,” answered Ed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, dear,” she said. “Why didn’t
you tell me sooner? I simply have to
have a young man today, and it’s too
late now to find anyone. I don’t know
what to do.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She was looking at me kind of
pleadingly and I said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is it anything I can do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ed gave her a foxy smile and said,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why sure, Lou. That’s just the
combination. Jack’s just the boy you
want.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“He looks as if he would be,” she
said, looking at me thoughtfully.
“I’m sure it’s awfully kind of you,
Mr. Henderson. I suppose you’ve
had experience in this work. Most
young men have.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I wasn’t very sure what she meant,
but I couldn’t think of any experience
just then that I hadn’t had, so I
trailed along after her as she started
for the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sorry you have to go, Jack,” Ed
said; “but we’ll see you again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It wasn’t such a bad trip. The
young lady was quite vivacious. She
told me that she was studying music
and put in her Sunday afternoons
playing in a dago mission Sunday
School. Then I began to tumble. I
sure hadn’t had any experience of that
kind.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’s the dearest class of little
boys,” she told me. “Italians and
Greeks, mostly, and so interesting. If
my time wasn’t so taken up with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>music I’d like to take them myself,
but I can’t do both, of course. It was
so sweet of you to volunteer, Mr.
Henderson.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I looked at her, but her face was
full of gratitude and friendliness, and
I couldn’t believe she was really trying
to work me. But I didn’t remember
volunteering to teach a class of
dirty little Ginnies.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ed comes down here frequently
and helps,” she said. “He finds the
work so interesting. And it is such
good experience, don’t you think so,
Mr. Henderson? Oh, here we are.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I felt weak. I looked up and down
the street, but couldn’t get out any
good reason for deserting the lady
just at that point. Before I had decided
on anything I found myself in a
big room full of chairs in rows with
kids placed around in bunches waiting
for the show to begin.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We’re a little late,” Miss Hargreaves
said, hastily; “but Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Smith will take care of you. Miss
Smith, this is Mr. Henderson. He
wants to teach the class we were
speaking of,” and she was chasing
down the aisle to the organ before I
could get my breath.</p>

<p class='c005'>The other young lady was very
cordial. She acted as though I was
all she had been waiting for. She
asked me if I had been in mission
work long, and what I thought of the
question of the evangelization of the
slums of the cities, and if I had a
quarterly. I answered “No” to the
last question—she didn’t give me
time to answer the others—and she
chased off and brought me a paper
book which, she said, had the lesson
in it.</p>

<p class='c005'>I looked around while she was off
for the book. There was just one
door to the room and a fat woman
was standing there, arguing with a
little boy who wanted to get out.
There didn’t seem to be much doing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>in that quarter, so I braced up and
prepared to take my medicine like a
man.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here are your boys,” she said,
piloting me to a bunch of greasy looking
little devils. “Boys, this is Mr.
Henderson. You must be real good
to him,” and she gave us all a sweet
smile and faded away.</p>

<p class='c005'>A pale young man with a Sunny
Jim face was standing by the bunch.
He told me he was the assistant superintendent
and had to keep order.
He said he always gave a little extra
attention to these boys.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I guess you’d better take them into
the class room early,” he said.
“They seem to be a bit uneasy today.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He opened a little door in the wall
and the kids fell over themselves into
the next room. Then the door was
shut, but I couldn’t have heard what
was doing in the next room, anyway,
for the way those little dagos were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>howling would have made a room full
of maniacs seem like a summer breeze.
Just to remind them that I was there
I picked up two of them and cracked
their heads together. That seemed to
interest them a little, and the other
boys stopped to take rubbers at the
fun. I couldn’t see as I was hurting
them any, so I went on batting them.
The rest of the crowd evidently got a
hunch as to what might be coming to
them, for they all filed over to a row
of chairs and sat down. It was so
still all of a sudden that I could hear
their heads crack as I brought them
together.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, see here,” said I, letting go
of the two interesting little dears I
was operating on, “I’m willing to do
the fair thing if you give me the
chance. If you can sit still without
talking or moving I’ll give you each
a quarter when they let us out of
here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dat’s Isidore Simon. He’ll get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>de quarter,” one of the kids said. But
the rest of them were too anxious for
the money to talk.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Remember,” I said, fearing I
hadn’t made it strong enough, “I’ll
pound daylight out of the first one of
you little devils that opens his
mouth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was enough. I sat there for
thirty-five minutes by my watch with
that row of brats sitting there as still
as if they were dead. The bell rang
and I let them file out into the other
room, and they did it in great style.
Then I had to chase out and get the
change to pay them off. As soon as
the meeting let out the two young
ladies and the assistant superintendent
piked up to me and began to all talk
at once.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Mr. Henderson,” the girls
said together, “we must congratulate
you on your success. You are perfectly
wonderful with children! No
one ever handled those boys so well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>before! Couldn’t you take the class
permanently?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Say, Billy, I thought I’d made a hit.
I thought that everything was coming
my way, from the way they crowded
each other to flash a happy look at me.
It must have made me kind of dizzy
to get it all in a bunch like that, for
before I could think what to say in
such a nice crowd as that, Ed’s sister-in-law
had got her jacket on and was
walking off with Sunny Jim.</p>

<p class='c005'>She looked back at me with a real
sweet smile. “Good-bye, Mr. Henderson,”
she said. “I’m awfully sorry,
but Mr. Williams and I have to go
to a committee meeting right away.
I wish you would come again. I think
it is lovely to meet a young man who
is so fond of children.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Wouldn’t kids be poison to you
after that? Just think, the best looking
of the two going off with a white
livered guy like that! If I had been
full she would have taken more notice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>of me. I was so sore that I didn’t
know that the other girl was talking
to me until I heard:</p>

<p class='c005'>“So if you’ll kindly excuse me I’ll
go and attend to it now. Mr. Williams
has so much to do, and I like
to help him all that I can. Don’t you
think he is a splendid young man, Mr.
Henderson? And such a worker!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think you’re all a bunch of
workers,” I said. But she just
smiled and said, “Oh, thank you!
Good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c005'>No more Sunday School for me,
Billy. It’s too costly for the returns.</p>
